A version of [terraoptifind](https://github.com/tureptor/terraoptifind) extended to include the NPCs from the Calamity mod.

I recommend unchecking Santa Claus, Bandit, Princess, Brimstone Witch until you are done tweaking with everyone else. They can be placed in loads of different groups, which makes the calculator slow down a lot.
